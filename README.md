# flight_analysis
Developed by: Pedro Neves and Rafaela Seguro (BSc Programming course project)

Using C basic principles, such as arrays, pointers and data in text files, and aircraft dynamics,
I co-wrote a program which computes the solution of differential equations describing the trajectory of an airplane using simple numerical methods
and graphs the corresponding trajectory, amongst other diagrams, and presents the range left for an airplane without fuel.

The program is initiated by running 'flight_analysis'.

Program written in Portuguese.
