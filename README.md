# flight_analysis
Developed by: Pedro Neves and Rafaela Seguro (BSc Programming course project)

This program computes the trajectory of an airplane, graphs it, amongst other diagrams, and computes the range left for an airplane without fuel.

Using C basic principles, such as arrays, pointers and data in text files, and aircraft dynamics,
I wrote a program which computes the solution of differential equations describing the trajectory of an airplane using simple numerical methods
and graphs the corresponding trajectory, amongst other diagrams.
