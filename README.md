# flight_analysis
This program computes the trajectory of an airplane, graphs it, amongst other diagrams, and computes the range left for an airplane without fuel.

Developed by: Pedro Neves and Rafaela Seguro (BSc Programming course project)

Using C basic principles, such as arrays, pointers and data in text files, and aircraft dynamics,
I wrote a program which computes the solution of differential equations describing the trajectory of an airplane using simple numerical methods
and graphs the corresponding trajectory, amongst other diagrams.
